**what is k8s?**

:- k8s is an open source software or container orchestrao system used to deploy ,scale and manage containers 

more about k8s?

:-K8s, also known as Kubernetes, is an open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.


*Key Features:*

1. Container management: Run containers across multiple hosts.
2. Automated deployment: Roll out new versions, roll back to previous versions.
3. Scaling: Increase/decrease replica count based on demand.
4. Self-healing: Automatically restart failed containers.
5. Resource management: Allocate resources (CPU, memory) to containers.
6. Service discovery: Manage communication between containers.
7. Security: Network policies, secret management.


*Components:*

1. Pods: Basic execution unit (one or more containers).
2. Replication Controllers: Manage pod replicas.
3. Services: Provide network identity and load balancing.
4. Persistent Volumes: Storage for data persistence.
5. Deployments: Manage rollouts and rollbacks.


*Benefits:*

1. Scalability
2. High availability
3. Flexibility
4. Efficient resource utilization
5. Simplified management


*Use cases:*

1. Web applications
2. Microservices architecture
3. Big data processing
4. Machine learning
5. Cloud-native applications


*Kubernetes Architecture:*

1. Master Node: Controls cluster.
2. Worker Nodes: Run pods.
3. pods : inside each node there are one or many pods which contains containers


*Popular Kubernetes Tools we use today **

1. kubectl (command-line tool)

** now what is need for k8s?
to manage ,deploy and scale containers more efficiently than a docker  ***

what is minikube?

minikube is a open source tool use to install k8s on your laptop 

why we use minikube to install k8s in our desktop? 

k8s is not free but minikube mimics k8s cloud computing features and provides k8s several extensions for free and along with it , it is easy to setup

 with the help of minikube we can run k8s applications and learn k8s concepts without cloud cost

 minikube has a single node k8s cluster artitechture although we will add more nodes in future 

 to use minikube you need atleast 2 gb ram and 2 cpu cores 20 gb free disk space  so make your instance accordingly


to use minikube :- first of all login on aws and launch an instance 
while making the instance select 2x t3micro and 33 or more gb storage if required 
after that connect the instance with putty and install docker 
after installation of docker call for nginix container 
after that install minikube on it 

in starting you can add a command so that you remain a user and don't meed to write sudo again and again


all the codes for above commands are mentioned below


    curl -sL https://github.com/ShubhamTatvamasi/docker-install/raw/master/docker-install.sh | bash
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

       $ newgrp docker

sudo snap install kubectl --classic

        kubectl version --client

         curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64

 sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

         minikube version

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

minikube start --driver=docker

minikube status

kubectl cluster-info

Kubectl config view

kubectl get nodes

kubectl get pods
