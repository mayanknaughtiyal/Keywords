2. Lightweight: Containers share the host's kernel, reducing overhead.
3. Portable: Containers run consistently across environments.
4. Isolation: Containers provide secure, isolated environments.
5. Scalability: Easily scale containers up or down.


*Benefits in Cloud Computing:*

1. Efficient Resource Utilization
2. Faster Deployment
3. Improved Security
4. Simplified Management
5. Enhanced Scalability
6. Better Compatibility
