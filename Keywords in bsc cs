üìò Computer Fundamentals ‚Äì Deep Tech Overview
üñ•Ô∏è What is a Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device capable of accepting input, processing it using a defined set of instructions, storing the result, and outputting it to the user. It automates complex computations and logical operations using hardware and software components. A modern computer typically comprises three primary domains:

A. Computation

B. Memory & Storage

C. Networking

üß† A. Computation (Processing Units)
A.1 CPU ‚Äì Central Processing Unit
The CPU is the core of any computing device, often referred to as the "brain" of the system. It carries out instructions from programs via the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Architectures include CISC (e.g., x86) and RISC (e.g., ARM).

A.2 DPU ‚Äì Data Processing Unit
A DPU (also known as SmartNIC or IPU) is a dedicated processor designed for data-centric tasks such as packet routing, encryption, and workload isolation in data centers. Prominent in cloud infrastructure, DPUs offload tasks from CPUs and improve security and performance.

Vendors: NVIDIA (BlueField), Intel, AMD (Pensando)

A.3 GPU ‚Äì Graphics Processing Unit
A GPU is optimized for parallel processing and matrix math operations, critical for rendering graphics and accelerating machine learning (ML) and scientific computations (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL).

A.4 APU ‚Äì Accelerated Processing Unit
An APU integrates both CPU and GPU on a single chip, enhancing performance and energy efficiency, especially in compact systems like laptops and consoles (e.g., AMD Ryzen APUs).

A.5 NPU ‚Äì Neural Processing Unit
An NPU is specialized for deep learning operations like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), providing high throughput and lower power consumption for AI workloads on edge devices.

A.6 TPU ‚Äì Tensor Processing Unit
A TPU is a Google-designed ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) built to accelerate TensorFlow operations. It is highly efficient for matrix multiplication, the backbone of deep learning.

A.7 FPGA ‚Äì Field-Programmable Gate Array
FPGAs are customizable chips that can be reprogrammed after manufacturing. They excel in low-latency and real-time environments like high-frequency trading, signal processing, and robotics.

A.8 ASIC ‚Äì Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
ASICs are purpose-built chips designed for specific tasks like Bitcoin mining (e.g., SHA-256 hashing). They offer performance and energy efficiency over general-purpose processors but lack flexibility.

A.9 CISC ‚Äì Complex Instruction Set Computing
CISC processors like x86 use a wide set of instructions that can perform complex tasks in a single command, often reducing code size at the expense of execution speed.

A.10 RISC ‚Äì Reduced Instruction Set Computing
RISC architectures (like ARM) use simpler instructions executed rapidly. RISC chips are energy-efficient, widely used in smartphones, embedded devices, and low-power environments.

A.11 RISC-V ‚Äì Open-Source ISA
RISC-V is an open-source ISA promoting customizable chip design. It‚Äôs modular, royalty-free, and increasingly adopted in embedded systems, IoT, and academic research.

A.12 SoC ‚Äì System on Chip
An SoC integrates CPU, GPU, memory controller, I/O, and other peripherals into a single silicon die, optimizing for power, size, and efficiency. Example: Apple M-series chips.

üß¨ B. Memory and Storage
Memory and storage systems retain data either temporarily or permanently.

B.1 Primary Memory (Volatile)
RAM (Random Access Memory): Fast, temporary storage for active processes and data.

Cache Memory: Small, fast memory inside the CPU for frequently accessed data.

B.2 Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile)
HDDs, SSDs: Store persistent data like files, OS, backups.

NVMe Storage: High-speed SSD interface offering low latency and high throughput.

Optane Memory: Intel‚Äôs hybrid memory/storage tech bridging RAM and SSD.

üåê C. Networking
Computer networking involves interconnecting devices to share data, applications, and services.

C.1 Internet
A global system of interconnected networks using TCP/IP to enable communication and data exchange.

C.2 DNS ‚Äì Domain Name System
Maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses (e.g., google.com ‚Üí 142.250.190.14). Acts like the internet‚Äôs phonebook.

C.3 IP ‚Äì Internet Protocol
IPv4: 32-bit addressing (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6: 128-bit addressing (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334) solving IP exhaustion.

IP Address Types:
Private (e.g., 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x)

Public (used on the WAN/Internet)

C.4 MAC ‚Äì Media Access Control
Hardware address uniquely identifying a device‚Äôs NIC (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E). Essential for LAN-level communications.

C.5 Port Numbers
Used in TCP/UDP networking to identify specific applications/services. Example: HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443.

C.6 OSI Model ‚Äì Open Systems Interconnection
A 7-layer abstraction model:

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application

‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain
A blockchain is a cryptographically secure, decentralized, and immutable ledger technology. Common in cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), supply chains, and smart contracts.

üñ•Ô∏è Operating System (OS)
An OS manages hardware resources and provides a user interface. It abstracts hardware complexity for application development.

Popular OS:

Windows

Linux (Ubuntu, Red Hat)

macOS

Kernel
The kernel is the core component of an OS that manages system calls, memory, CPU scheduling, and hardware communication.

Bare Metal
Refers to running workloads directly on hardware without an OS or hypervisor layer. Useful in performance-critical and embedded systems.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing
Delivery of computing services over the internet. On-demand, scalable, and metered usage.

Types:
Private Cloud ‚Äì Managed internally (e.g., OpenStack)

Public Cloud ‚Äì AWS, Azure, GCP

VM ‚Äì Virtual Machine
Software emulation of a physical machine. VMs run guest OSs and apps independently on shared hardware via a hypervisor (e.g., VMware, KVM).

üßÆ Algorithms
A finite set of logical steps to solve a problem or perform computations. Examples: sorting, searching, pathfinding (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).

üì¶ Kubernetes (K8s)
Open-source orchestration platform for managing containerized applications (e.g., Docker). Provides auto-scaling, self-healing, service discovery, and rolling updates.

üîå API ‚Äì Application Programming Interface
